// TODO Suggested to be in Location service... This is test data.
// Refactored, I think this should be data-only code, without dependency on Location service.
// Not too sure what to do with this now...
// I think one way to notice this is to find public static final constants.
// Probably do not want to add these as environment variables either, becomes a mess.
// Maybe these are marked as: "Work needs to be done to make these classes functional"? Refactoring this is probably the best way unless we find a solution that developers will be happy with.
// Perhaps an option is to add these in the proto as well as constants if that is possible? Not really the right location imo as it is test data.
  // Maybe a "SampleLocations.getStatic(String)"? Potentially different return types in other cases...
  // Worst case: Different call for every variable. Would be easier to deal with probably...
